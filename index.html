        <p> In a world with the Internet, Skype, Facebook, Twitter, and FaceTime, we
          have the most access to information than we've ever had before. Something I've noticed though,
          is that while we're supposed to be the closest to each other as we've ever been, it seems like we've become the most distant instead.
          So many horrible, horrendous things have happened elsewhere in the world, yet it seems more often than not, these cruelties become a footnote
          in our dinner talks, to be glossed over once and forgotten about in time for the next headline. While some of these photos are <u>graphic</u>, I feel that
          it is important to have them on here, so that I, and hopefully others, can come back once and a while to remember and also be reminded of
          the good fortune that we have to be away from war, famine, disease, and other terrible occurances. </p>

          <p> With more and more border closures and declines in granting asylum to Greece, more and more refugees are waylaid in the Mediterranean
            as they hope to gain access to Europe in hopes to escape their wartorn or violent homelands. </p>

          <h4> The Syrian War Crisis </h4>
          <p> With constant on-going war in Syria, millions of civilians lose their homes and lives in Syria. Many are without clean water and sanitation.
            There is a stunning lack of healthcare services to provide relief as well. Children experience devastating hardships and tradegy as they lose
            their families and homes in war-torn Syria. </p>
